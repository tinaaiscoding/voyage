This is the last project with the General Assembly Bootcamp. We were given the opportunity to showcase our skills and creativity and create whatever we like!

My app is going to be an app to plan your holiday itinerary. It will be integrating 3 different APIs.
The idea was to use unrelated topics and make them relatable.

External:
- Weather API
- Location API

Internal:
- Clothing API

The app's main features will be for users to select their holiday destination, view the weather at the selected destinations, and produce a simple clothes packing guide.
The app displays a map to show the selected destinations.
Users can filter whether they want a summer or winter holiday, and if they have a specific date of travel, the app will display the countries in the desired weather conditions.
